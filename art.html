    <H1> Art Collections</H1>

<p>Certain museums are known for their very distinct art colletions.  Others, such as 
    Le Louvre, known for the Mona Lisa painted by Michaelangelo, are known for a 
    crown jewel in their treasure trove of masterpieces.  The Mona Lisa is valued at 
    approximtely $800 million.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Sculptures</h2>
  
<p> These museums also house impressive sculptures such as "Cupid's Kiss" and Greek and
    Roman sculptures. </p>

    <h3>Contemporary Art</h3>
    <p>These large museums also carry contemporary art collections.  These collections 
        appear juxtaposed against much older art, but they are a reminder that art, although
        ephemeral, can endure for the future generations to enjoy.
