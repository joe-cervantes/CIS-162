          <p> Neopolitian pizza is the first ever style of pizza that was invented  
              in the late 16th century in Naples, Italy. In 1889, Raffaele Esposito created
              the Pizza Margherita for Queen Margherita of Sevoy. He used tomatoes, mozzarella,
              and basil to reflect the Italian flag.
            <br>
            <br>
              There are four ingredients that must be used for a pizza to be correctly
            classified as a Neapolitan style pizza.  Marzano tomotoes, finely refined flour that is usually 
            classified as 0 or 00 zero flour, natural mozarella cheese, and fresh basil.

                  Fresh basil also adds to the presentation with its beautiful green
