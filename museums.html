<p>Dating as far back as prehistoric times, hominids and modern humans created art for 
    many reasons, including spiritual, decorative, and in memoriam of their 
    daily lives.  Through art, the objects created  by socieities in antiquity
    remain amongst our treasured posessions in museum halls.  These items serve as a testament
    to the human spirit and the need for mankind to create beauty out its surroundings.

    <h2>The Metropolitan Museum of Art</h2>
    <p>The larger, well-known, museums carry an eclectic collection of art pieces.
        Sometimes, these collections span 5,000 years of world culture.  Othere times, 
        art museums focus on just a sliver of the the art world.  A simple niche that 
        may have a large following of patrons.
    </p>

    <p>The Met, as the Metropolitan Museum of Art is colloquially called, houses some
        iconic paintings.  The Girl with a Pearl Earring, Washington Crossing the Delaware,
        Jackson Pollock paintings, and Vincent Van Gogh paintings.

<h3>The J. Paul Ghetty</h3> 

<p>The Getty has a large number of collections spanning from BCE 1300 to the present.  
    A visitor can lose herself in the many rooms filled with art that ranges from antiquity
    to contemporary modern art.  In their bookstore, one can even find the L.A. Graffiti 
    Black Book that was comissioned by the Getty.
